    <h1>About Firewall Security</h1>
    <p>Why firewalls are the foundation of cybersecurity in the modern digital world.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="about-content">
    <p>Firewalls have evolved to protect organizations from a wide range of cyberattacks, including malware, unauthorized access, and data breaches. They analyze traffic patterns, detect suspicious activity, and enforce strict access control policies.</p>
    <p>In modern networks, firewalls are implemented both as hardware and software. Cloud firewalls now secure virtual infrastructures, offering scalability and intelligent threat detection.</p>
    <p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> The first firewall concept was introduced in the late 1980s when internet security was in its infancy!</p>
